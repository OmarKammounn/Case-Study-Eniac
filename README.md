## Part 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

In the initial phase of the Data Science Bootcamp project, I engaged in thorough data exploration and cleansing tasks, utilizing SQL and Python to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.

### Understanding the Project Context

I began by gaining a comprehensive understanding of Eniac, an e-commerce enterprise that specializes in Apple products and accessories.

### Exploring and Cleansing the Dataset

Leveraging SQL and Python, I meticulously explored and cleansed the dataset to address inconsistencies, data quality issues, and gaps. My aim was to create a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

### Formulating Questions and Extracting Insights

Using SQL and Python, I formulated critical questions about the data and harnessed their answers to extract valuable insights. This process laid the groundwork for deeper analyses and meaningful discoveries.

## Part 2: Business Analysis

During this phase, conducted within the Data Science Bootcamp, I conducted a detailed business analysis, addressing Eniac's concerns through statistical analysis and visualization, employing SQL, Python, and Tableau.

### Analyzing Business Challenges

I delved into Eniac's intricate business challenges, including pricing strategy, discount optimization, and delivery efficiency. By employing SQL and Python, I dissected the data to extract actionable insights.

### Utilizing Statistical Techniques and Data Visualization

Using Python and Tableau, I applied advanced statistical techniques and data visualization to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and opportunities within the dataset. This process facilitated deeper understanding and data-driven decision-making.

### Preparing for the Next Phase

I skillfully organized my findings and insights using Python and Tableau, priming them for presentation to stakeholders. This preparation set the stage for the next phase of the project, focused on website optimization.

## Part 3: Website Optimization with A/B Testing and Final Presentation

In the final segment of the Data Science Bootcamp project, I shifted my attention to enhancing Eniac's e-commerce website using A/B testing, Python, and statistical principles. This phase culminated in a comprehensive presentation.

### Understanding User Behavior and the Purchase Funnel

Using Python, I analyzed user behavior and the purchase funnel on the website, elucidating the pathways that lead to conversions.

### Exploring A/B Testing and Experimental Design

I delved into the principles of A/B testing using Python, considering different versions of the website to optimize user experience. I addressed critical questions about metrics, data analysis, and experiment duration.

### Implementing Website Optimization Strategies

With Python, I explored potential website changes and addressed concerns related to metrics, data tracking, and test duration. The objective was to enhance the website for improved user engagement and conversion rates.

### Concluding with a Comprehensive Presentation

The culmination of this phase was a well-prepared presentation, encompassing insights, findings, and recommendations gathered throughout the project. This presentation provided a platform to communicate results and drive data-driven actions.

## Conclusion

The Eniac Data Science Bootcamp Project represents a comprehensive analysis of Eniac's data, business challenges, and avenues for improvement. By applying SQL, Python, and Tableau, I sought to provide meaningful insights, valuable recommendations, and a solid foundation for informed decision-making.
