## Part 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

The initial phase of the Data Science Bootcamp project involved in-depth data exploration and cleansing tasks, with the dataset's accuracy and reliability ensured through the use of SQL and Python.

### Understanding the Project Context

A comprehensive understanding of Eniac, an e-commerce enterprise specializing in Apple products and accessories, was obtained.

### Exploring and Cleaning the Dataset

The dataset was thoroughly explored and cleansed using SQL and Python, addressing inconsistencies, data quality issues, and gaps. The goal was to establish a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

### Formulating Questions and Extracting Insights

Utilizing SQL and Python, critical questions about the data were formulated and their answers were utilized to extract valuable insights. This process laid the groundwork for deeper analyses and meaningful discoveries.

## Part 2: Business Analysis

In this phase, conducted within the Data Science Bootcamp, a detailed business analysis was carried out. Eniac's concerns were addressed through statistical analysis and visualization, facilitated by the use of SQL, Python, and Tableau.

### Analysis of Business Challenges

Eniac's complex business challenges, including pricing strategy, discount optimization, and delivery efficiency, were explored. SQL and Python were employed to dissect the data and extract actionable insights.

### Application of Statistical Techniques and Data Visualization

Using Python and Tableau, advanced statistical techniques and data visualization were employed to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and opportunities within the dataset. This process facilitated deeper understanding and data-driven decision-making.

### Preparation for the Next Phase

Findings and insights were skillfully organized using Python and Tableau, preparing them for presentation to stakeholders. This preparation set the stage for the subsequent phase of website optimization.

## Part 3: Website Optimization with A/B Testing and Final Presentation

The final segment of the Data Science Bootcamp project focused on enhancing Eniac's e-commerce website using A/B testing, Python, and statistical principles. This phase culminated in a comprehensive presentation.

### Understanding User Behavior and the Purchase Funnel

Python was utilized to analyze user behavior and the purchase funnel on the website, providing insights into the pathways leading to conversions.

### Exploration of A/B Testing and Experimental Design

Principles of A/B testing were explored using Python, considering different website versions to optimize user experience. Critical questions about metrics, data analysis, and experiment duration were addressed.

### Implementation of Website Optimization Strategies

Using Python, potential website changes were explored, along with addressing concerns related to metrics, data tracking, and test duration. The objective was to enhance the website for improved user engagement and conversion rates.

### Conclusion with a Comprehensive Presentation

The culmination of this phase was a well-prepared presentation, encompassing insights, findings, and recommendations gathered throughout the project. This presentation provided a platform to communicate results and drive data-driven actions.

## Conclusion

The Eniac Data Science Bootcamp Project signifies a comprehensive analysis of Eniac's data, business challenges, and avenues for improvement. By applying SQL, Python, and Tableau, meaningful insights, valuable recommendations, and a solid foundation for informed decision-making were provided.
